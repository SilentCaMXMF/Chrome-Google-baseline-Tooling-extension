# Privacy Policy for Baseline Checker for Cloud IDEs

Last updated: 17/09/2025

Baseline Checker for Cloud IDEs ("we", "our", or "the Extension") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data and permissions when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

The extension does **not** collect any personal information by default. We may temporarily access:

- **Active tab URL**: Only to analyze code in your current Cloud IDE tab.
- **Code from the editor**: Extracted solely to check web platform features against Baseline data.

We do **not** store or transmit your code or personal information to any server.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- `activeTab` & `tabs`: To read the content of the currently active tab in order to analyze the code.
- `storage`: To save your extension settings locally in Chrome.
- `scripting`: To inject scripts into the active tab for analysis.
- `webNavigation`: To monitor editor page load and trigger analysis.
- `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>` or specific Cloud IDE URLs): Required to access the editor page content.

We only use these permissions for the purposes described above and do not share any data.

## Data Usage

- The extension runs entirely locally in your browser.  
- No code or user data is transmitted to external servers.  
- Any analysis results are displayed locally in the extension popup.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does **not** use any analytics, tracking, or third-party services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be informed via updates in the repository and Chrome Web Store listing.
